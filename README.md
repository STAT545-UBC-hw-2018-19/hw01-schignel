## About Me

I'm a first year PhD student in the <a href="https://ires.ubc.ca/">**Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability**</a> at UBC. I grew up in Hawai'i but have lived in Colorado and Illinois for most of my adult life.

I have a background in **Geography** and **Watershed Science**. I also have an undergraduate degree in **Music**!

## Research Interests
I'm mostly interested in trying to understand the relationships between **people** and **nature**. This includes applied questions about the sustainable management of water resources, as well as more philosophical questions about different worldviews and epistomologies, and how these shape the way we study the environment.

#### Maps
I enjoy working with geospatial data and satellite imagery, and have a soft spot for maps--particularly old ones like the one below...

#### Networks
I've recently become very interested in network analysis, and am hoping to put some of my new R skills learned in this class to use making beautiful network visualizations.

#### Environmental History
I have also been involved in a project tracing the history of science and human impact in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. You can see some of the historic photos and other results of this work <a href="https://mcmurdohistory.lternet.edu/">at this link</a>.

### Other things
Outside of research I also enjoy:

1. Hiking (and simply being outside)
2. Spending time with friends and family
3. Music

	- composing  :musical_score:
	- playing  :guitar:
	
#### Looking forward to the semester!
