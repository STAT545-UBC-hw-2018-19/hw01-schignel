## Overview
The following sections will demonstrate exploratory data analysis in R. We will start by familiziarizing ourselves with the *gapminder* dataset, and then produce a few plots to visualize interesting patterns in the data.


### Load the dataset
```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

#### Explore its structure
The "str" function provides detailed information on the type and composition of the dataset:
```{r}
str(gapminder)
```
We can see that the dataset has 6 fields (or "variables"), with 1704 entries (or "observations"). Some of these contain numerical data and others contain text data.


#### Summarize the data
The "summary" function provides basic descriptive statistics of each field:

```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```
Here we see that we are working with demographic information from a variety of countries ranging from the years 1952-2007. Already we can identify some interesting information. For example,

- Life expectany ranges from 23.60 to 82.60 years
- Population ranges from 60,010 to 1,319,000,000


```{r}
hist(gapminder$pop)
```


Let's find which countries and years these values are associated with. 

```{r}
head(gapminder)
```


### Plot the data
Let's use the "plot" function in base R to see how population has changed over time.
We can also provide basic labels with "ylab", "xlab", and "main".
```{r}
plot(gapminder$year,gapminder$pop, 
     ylab = "Population (scientific notation", 
     xlab ="Year",
     main = "Population through time")
```
We see that population has been increasing, but there are two trends that are far steeper and greater than the rest of the data. 

























## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
